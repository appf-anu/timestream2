# Glossary

These terms have specific meaning in this code:


- **Instant**: A specific point in time and space that resulted in an image. For simple time streams, this will be the date, time, and any recorded sub-second time or series. For pan-tilt timestreams (i.e. GigaVision), this include the position within the super-image (e.g date, time, subsecond, and some measure of x and y coordinate).
